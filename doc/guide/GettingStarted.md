### Installation

Add the Swift Package repository. If you're unfamiliar, checkout Apple's [instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).

```
https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-ios
```


### Usage

#### 1. [Sign up](https://console.mytiki.com) (free) for a TIKI developer account to get an API ID.

#### 2. Construct the [TIKI SDK](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk)

Configuration parameters:

- **apiId &#8594; String**   
A unique identifier for your account. Create, revoke, and cycle Ids _(not a secret but try and treat it with care)_ at https://mytiki.com.


- **origin &#8594; String**  
Included in the on-chain transaction to denote the application of origination (can be overridden in individual requests). It should follow a reversed FQDN syntax. _i.e. com.mycompany.myproduct_


Example:

```
    let tiki = TikiSdk("565b3268-cdc0-4e5c-94c8-5d8f53d4577c", "com.mycompany.myproduct");
```

#### 3. Assign ownership
Data ownership can be assigned to any data point, pool, or stream, creating an immutable, on-chain record.

Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data. _i.e. a user_id_


- **type &#8594; String**  
`"point"`, `"pool"`, or `"stream"`


- **completion &#8594; ((success: Bool, response: String?) &#8594; Void)?**  
A callback function to execute on completion. Input (**String**) is the unique transaction id (use to recall the transaction record at any time)


- **about &#8594; String?**  
An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.


- **contains &#8594; List&lt;String>**
A list of metadata tags describing the represented data


- **origin &#8594; String?**  
An optional override of the default origin set during initialization


Example:

```
let completion = { (success: Bool, response: String) -> print(response) };
tiki.assignOwnership("12345", "point", completion, ["email_address"]);
```

#### 4. Modify consent
Consent is given (or revoked) for data ownership records. Consent defines "who" the data owner has given utilization rights.

Parameters:
- **ownershipId &#8594; String**  
The transaction id for the ownership grant


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
A collection of paths and application use cases that consent has been granted (or revoked) for.


- **completion &#8594; ((success: Bool, response: String?) &#8594; Void)?**
A callback function executed on completion. Input (**String**) is the modified consent.


- **about &#8594; String?**  
An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.


- **reward &#8594; String?**  
An optional definition of a reward promised to the user in exchange for consent.


Example:
```
let completion = { (success: Bool, response: String) -> print(response) };
tiki.modifyConsent(oid, TikiSdkDestination(["*"], ["*"]), completion);
```

#### 5. Apply consent
Apply consent to a data transaction. If consent is granted for the `source` and `destination` and has not expired, the request is executed.

Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data.  
_i.e. a user_id_


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
The destination(s) and use case(s) for the request.


- **request &#8594; ((String?) &#8594; Void)**  
The function to execute if consent granted


- **onBlocked &#8594; ((String?) &#8594; Void)**  
The function to execute if consent is denied.


Example:
```
applyConsent("12345", TikiSdkDestination(["*"], ["*"]),
             {(_) -> print("Consent Approved. Send data to backend.")},
             {(_) -> print("Consent Denied.")});
```
