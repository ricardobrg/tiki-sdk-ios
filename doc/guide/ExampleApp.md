1.	Clone the TIKI SDK iOS repository.

`git clone https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-ios.git`

2.	Open the tiki-sdk-ios/ExampleApp/SwiftUI/TikiSdkExample.xcodeproj in XCode

3.	Run the app in the simulator or physical device

_Note: The TIKI SDK iOS repository main branch keeps the Debug version of the dependency Frameworks. To run the Release version, checkout the latest tag._

## SDK initialization

The first initialization of the SDK is done without passing a wallet address as a parameter This tells the TIKI SDK to create a new wallet on startup. The corresponding TikiSdk object is saved in the SDK Dictionary, with the address as the key.

#### TikiSdkExample/SwiftUI/TikiSdkExample/Wallet/WalletView.swift - lines 41 to 46

```
let origin = "com.mytiki.tiki_sdk_example"
let apiId = "2b8de004-cbe0-4bd5-bda6-b266d54f5c90"
let tikiSdk = try await TikiSdk(origin: origin, apiId: apiId)
appModel.walletList.append(tikiSdk.address!)
appModel.wallets[tikiSdk.address!] = tikiSdk
appModel.selectedWalletAddress = tikiSdk.address!
```

It is possible to switch wallets while using the application. This functionality is used to simulate SDK initialization on a device where the user has previously created a wallet or in a multi-tenant application. When a valid address is passed as a parameter a new TIKI SDK iOS instance is created for the wallet.

_Note: The TIKI SDK requires a valid private key for the address, saved in its secure storage. This is managed automatically by the SDK for any wallets created locally._

#### TikiSdkExample/SwiftUI/TikiSdkExample/Wallet/WalletView.swift - lines 67 to 70

```
func switchTo(addr: String){
    appModel.selectedWalletAddress = addr
    self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
}
```

**Important:** By design, the TIKI SDK does not save the addresses of created wallets. This information must be saved by the application in a local or remote persistence.

## Ownership NFT

When a new wallet is created, the application creates an Ownership NFT for the default data source using the `assignOwnership` call and passing said data source. The source parameter can be any String that uniquely identifies the data. For this example, we use a random UUID defined in the destination object.

#### TikiSdkExample/SwiftUI/TikiSdkExample/Wallet/WalletView.swift - lines 48 to 56

```
let _ = try await appModel.tikiSdk!.assignOwnership(
    source: appModel.stream.source, 
    type: TikiSdkDataTypeEnum.stream, 
    contains: ["generic data"], 
    about: "Data stream created with TIKI SDK Sample App")
let ownership = try await appModel.tikiSdk?.getOwnership(source: appModel.stream.source)
appModel.ownershipDictionary[tikiSdk.address!] = ownership!
```

## Consent NFT

In the sample application, for convenience, we auto-create a Consent NFT on wallet initialization. The requested URL is used as the `TikiSdkDestination` path, and the method is marked as the use case.

#### TikiSdkExample/SwiftUI/TikiSdkExample/Wallet/WalletView.swift - lines 52 to 58

```
let path: String = URL(string:appModel.stream.url)!.host!
let use: String = appModel.stream.httpMethod
let destination = TikiSdkDestination(paths: [path], uses: [use])
let consent: TikiSdkConsent = try await appModel.tikiSdk!.modifyConsent(
    ownershipId: appModel.ownership!.transactionId, 
    destination: destination, 
    about: "Consent given to echo data in remote server", 
    reward: "Test the SDK", 
    expiry: Calendar.current.date(byAdding: DateComponents(year: 10), to: Date())!)
appModel.consentDictionary[ownership!.transactionId] = consent
appModel.isConsentGiven = true
isLoading = false
```

Additional Consent NFTs are created when the user turns the _"toggle consent"_ switch on or off. When changing other destination data, the Consent NFT is not modified.

## Outbound Requests

The example app executes an HTTP request in the time interval defined in the destination screen. Before each request, the app calls the `applyConsent` method from TIKI SDK. If Consent has been given, the request is executed. If not, the request is denied and a blocked message is showed in the log.

```
func sendDataToServer(){
    if(appModel.tikiSdk == nil){
        log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message: "ERROR: Create a Wallet"))
    }else{
        Task{
            let url = URL(string: appModel.stream.url)!
            let path: String = url.host!
            let use: String = appModel.stream.httpMethod
            let destination = TikiSdkDestination(paths: [path], uses: [use])
            let body: String = appModel.stream.body
            var request = URLRequest(url: url)
            request.httpMethod = "POST"
            request.httpBody = Data(body.utf8)
            request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
            try await appModel.tikiSdk!.applyConsent(source: appModel.stream.source, destination: destination, request: {
                let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
                    guard
                        let data = data,
                        let response = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
                        error == nil
                    else {
                        log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message: "ERROR: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? URLError(.badServerResponse).localizedDescription)"))
                        return
                    }
                    
                    guard (200 ... 299) ~= response.statusCode else {
                        log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message:"\(response.statusCode): \(HTTPURLResponse.localizedString(forStatusCode: response.statusCode))"))
                        return
                    }
                    do{
                        let jsonData = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as! [String: Any]
                        guard let jsonDictionary : Dictionary<String, AnyObject> = jsonData["json"] as? Dictionary else{
                            log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message: "Error: Malformed JSON repsonse"))
                            return
                        }
                        log.append(StreamLog(icon:"ðŸŸ¢", message:"\(response.statusCode): \(jsonDictionary)"))
                        DispatchQueue.main.async {
                            appModel.isConsentGiven = true

                    }catch{
                        log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message: "Error: \(error.localizedDescription)"))
                        return
                    }
                }
                task.resume()
            }, onBlocked: { reason in
                log.append(StreamLog(icon: "ðŸ”´", message: "Blocked: consent required"))
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    appModel.isConsentGiven = false
                }
                return
            })
